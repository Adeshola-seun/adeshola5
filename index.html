  <h2> Law 24: PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER </h2>
<img src="law24.jpg">
  <p>The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity.
 He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors,
 and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner.
Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.
A courtier is someone who attends a royal court as an adviser or companion to the king or queen.
 To be a courtier was quite a dangerous game because they were often used as a scapegoat.
 Living the life of a courtier was like walking life on a tight rope; courtiers had to learn to master the balance between pleasing, while not pleasing too much.
 It was a dangerous game, but there is a lot to learn from these magicians of behaviour.

  <h2> Law 29: PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END. </h2>
  <img src="law29.jpg">
  <p>The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles,
   and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others.
   By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop.
   Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.
 The ending is everything - it is the end of action that determines who gets the glory, the money, the prize.
  Your conclusion must be crystal clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind.</p>

    <h2> Law 46: NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT.</h2>
    <img src="law46.jpg">
<p>Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses.
   Envy creates silent enemies.
   It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable.
   Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.</p>
